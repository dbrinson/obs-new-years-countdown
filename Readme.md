# New Years Countdown OBS Plugin

A simple html countdown that streamers can use to ring in the new year. I may add customization options for this, but no further plans at the moment.

To use it with obs follow these instructions:
1. download the files to your computer
2. open `countdown.html` in your browser
3. select the desired timezone (or one to start with)
4. tweak the date to countdown to by adjusting the `countdown` URL parameter
5. tweak the text displayed above the countdown using the `text` URL parameter
